    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sesame seeds, toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander until the water runs clear. Combine with water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Rice should be tender and water should be absorbed. Cool until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Cool, then stir into the cooked rice. When you pour this in, pour it in all the way around the edge of the rice, rather than right onto the rice.</li>
        <li>On a sushi mat, place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards. Wet your hands. Using your hands, spread a thin layer of rice on the sheet of nori, and press into a thin layer. Arrange 1/4 of the cucumber, ginger, avocado and imitation crabmeat in a line down the center of the rice. Lift the end of the mat, and gently roll it over the ingredients, pressing gently. Roll it forward to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices using a wet, sharp knife.</li>
    </ol>
